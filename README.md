# Linked Notes

A tool for parsing markdown notes specifically for academic note taking.

Given a directory of markdown notes this tool can parse each note into a structured representation and implements an efficient cache for creating and editing references between those notes.

The two types of references the tool supports are wikilinks and citations.
